9 October 2024 v 1.7.4
- Clang-format according to FreeBSD style(9)
- Multiple passes with Clang-16 and gcc-10 -Wall cleaning up warnings
- Removed cruft supporting K&R compilers and ancient systems, long may they live
- Cleaned up the makefile
- All functions have (or should have) prototypes so the compiler can find bugs
- Fixed uninitialized values and null dereference found with GCC-10 -fanalyzer
- Fixed a small number of the many many things splint still complains about

30 October 2008 (Thu) v 1.7.4alpha
- streamlined flags handling using token pasting
- changed permissions and mode flag values to enums
- fixed hilite status messages, especially empty case for "none"
- added new ring_buffer struct for formatted histories
  but decided not to add histories due to privacy issues.
- added dotspeeddial for .p foo  going to last number .p'd
- fixed annoying wrap bug when line breaks are at wrap column.
- added wrap width to player struct, .r# sets to width, .r toggles on and off,
  .r0 toggles off.
- fixed yell mode bugs stage (poses and escaped (>) stage poses to channel.)
- added help text for > escape in Yell mode enabled msg.
- help system no longer crashes when a record with no | separator is encountered.
- added testring and testhelp targets to test the ring buffer and help modules.
- updated .f# to dump more of the player struct and all flags (set/unset) and privs
- fixed buffer overflow in idle time formatting for 64-bit time_t implementations,
  would have triggered at hrs>999,999 (114+ years)


23 February 2005 (Wed) v 1.7.3
- Made who list search host and doing fields
- Made players silent (no arrival/departure) until named
- Silent players have chnl==NULL, so modified places like 
  who list, finger, removeplayer to ignore NULL channels.
- Added ANTISPAM bait and logging features for catching spammers.
  Enable with -DANTISPAM
- fixed a bug in .i's whereby missing line numbers weren't reported
- allow .i 250 YOYO to echo "250 YOYO" globally, but .i250 YOYO goes
  to line 250.

26 December 2004 (sun) v1.7.2h
- Fixed wedge bug related to player removal (incorrect prev pointer maintenance) 

3 October 2003 (fri) v1.7.2g
- Fixed several crash bugs related to player removal (more probably exist)
- Added stage pose feature.

12 June 2003 (Thu) v1.7.2f
- Added feature to retain original hostname.

10 June 2003 (Tue)
- Updated changedlog for 20 Aug 1999.

20 Aug 1999 (Fri) v1.7.2e
- Removed global_lineno nonsense from newplayer once and for all.
- Fixed a bug where ungagging might not ungag the right line in the process
- Fixed a bug where players were not removed early enough.
  Also known as the "too many dead sockets crash the soup" bug.
- Fixed a bug where a check for gagged message might overrun the buffer,
  especially if the message is a .i...  the right fix is probably to not
  reconstruct the line number from the message but to track the fd 
  all the way through...
- bumped version to 1.7.2e

26 July 1997 (Sat) 
  - Fixed bug in servsock.c which occasionally caused main channel to be 
    nameless.

22 June 1997 (Sun) v1.7.2c
  - Minor aesthetic fix in parse.c.  When an op attempted to remove a 
    ban that did not exist, the message ">> (null) removed from banlist"
	went to all players.  Now an error message goes to the op.  
	Thanks to ken@sector7.com (Ken Persinger) for the report.

23 Mar 1997 (Sun) v1.7.2b
  - Added Yellmode.  Thanks to Kazi (Isaac Kishk) for the suggestion.

01 November 1996 (Fri) v1.7.2a
  - Fixed bug in newplayer.c which caused recvbuf to be overrun.  This
    didn't affect all systems, for some reason but caused inexplicable
	crashes periodically under SunOS and under some Linux distributions
	caused the main channel name to be overwritten with the NUL character.
	Thanks to Charlie Ross for providing a debugging environment and 
	reporting the bug.
30 October 1996 (Wed) v1.7.2
  - Fixed bug in parse.c which caused players to be removed twice
    when they quit.  This does not constitute a new release.
	Thanks to Charlie Ross for all his helpful feedback on this one.
24 October 1996 (Thu) v1.7.2
  - Integrated minor changes from all over the place to make things
    compile on various machines.  Thanks to Amanda Green (Eliste),
	Eli (Ski Bub), Charlie Ross (Charles.A.Ross@cc.gettysburg.edu)
	and Dan Lawrence (Bergon) for feedback on builds.
  - Added Bergon's (Dan Lawrence) changes to the log function to 
    put times with messages.
  - This release is meant to get the 1.7.1-alpha code out as 
    a stable version and to be an official release.  Somehow 
	there are some tainted releases out there going by the names
	1.7.0a and 1.7.1-alpha.  (Thanks to Charlie Ross for the feedback)

28 March 1995 (Tue) 
  - Ban information is sent to everyone regardless of flags.
  - Modified settablesize() to disallow setting the size to
    less than the highest numbered fd in use.

27 March 1995 (Mon) v1.7.1-alpha
  - Added /Mo to modify the file descriptor count.
  - Removed /g forever.  It's far more effective to throw
    someone on their own channel and lock them there.
  - Added /Purgelog to purge the log.
  - Added /I (ignore .I's)
  - Moved all toggle fields in the structure to a bit the flags field.
  - Minor changes to facilitate new list code.

26 March 1995 (Sun)
  - Removed maxconn.h from sources.  This is now taken care of via
    a call to gettablesize()
  - Added files.c to distribution.  This houses the following functions:
       gettablesize()
       settablesize()
       getdtablesize()
       setdtablesize()
    Note that getdtablesize() and setdtablesize() are only defined
    by the sources if they are undefined on the target system.
  - Changed the gags field to be an fd_set.
  - There was a bug by which you could gag players that did not
    exist.  This is now fixed.
  - Cleaned up some of the code.

25 March 1995 (Sat) v1.7.0b-beta
  - Incorporated changes necessary to port to DYNIX/PTX 2.0
  - Updated the README file.

17 March 1995 (Fri)
  - Removed all the vives from Hermit's original haven code
    and incorporated the changes.  Thanks to windswept for the
    report.  From Windswept's home page:  "lorien is devived
    from the original haven by Chris Eleveld (The Insane Hermit)"

01 March 1995 (Wed) 
  - Changed handleinput() to avoid some potentially nasty problems
    that as yet haven't been encountered, including core dumps
    and such due to removing players for sending too much input.
  - Detected before and after call to processinput() whether a player
    is leaving.  If so, refrain from processing the input.
    This should avoid people queuing up large amounts of input
    and output and then leaving, letting the haven spin its wheels
    for nothing.
  - Now sets leaving flag in sendtoplayer() allowing us to detect a
    dead socket at any point of execution.  This should keep the
    log from filling up with "error attemtping to send" messages.
  - Thanks to Random (Corey Espich) and Krelin (Brian Crowder) for
    the bug reports.

19 February 1995 (Sun)
  - Changed parse.c to properly place the braces inside the preprocessor
    directives for the ONFROM_ANY define.  Thanks to Random (Corey Espich)
    for the bug report.

16 February 1995 (Thu) v1.7.0a
  - Well, that didn't take long!  Thanks to Wakko Warner (Michael McClellan)
    for alpha testing.
  - HP/UX documentation is now much better.
  - getmax.c now looks for itself when -DNO_GETDTABLESIZE is defined,
    instead of the elusive hpgetmax.c :)
  - security.h has the backslash removed.
  - the Makefile defaults to defining -DUSE_CONFIG_H instead of
    -DDEFAULT_NAME and -DDEFCHAN, which don't work under some
    implementations of csh and bourne shell.  Good thing I had the
    foresight to realize this and wasn't too upset, eh?
  - The annoying pose bug is fixed.  (*buf = ',')
  
    
16 February 1995 (Thu) v1.7.0
  - Numerous changes since November, mostly bug fixes.
  - Updated the documentation.
  - Changed the code a bit to center the configuration process more
    around the Makefile and added comments to the makefile.
  - NEW:  The file lorien.block contains initial bans.
  - NEW:  The file lorien.power contains passwords.  Restart the program
          and it will re-read the file.  The format is one password per
          line, as below
          level0
          level1
          level2
          level3
          level4
          level5
          shutdown password
  - Poses now have no space inserted after the name if the first character
    is either an apostrophe or a comma.  Thanks to Krelin (Brian Crowder)
    for the diffs.
  - semicolons now work as poses in addition to colons.
  - /ban is now available for everyone, to check the banlist
  - /bandel and /banadd now broadcast to everyone as an arrival class
    message.
  - Fixed hilites so that the status string has \r\n in it.
    Now it actually shows before the next output comes your way :)
  - Added CANQUIT ("/CQ" and CANCAPS "/CC" to the privileges mask
  - Changed CANCHANNEL flag specifier for /C from 'C' to 'T'
  - Fixed .M bug---error message when no channel name is specified.  Thanks
    to Random (Corey Espich) for the report.
  - Fixed input buffer overrun bug that SubZero was exploiting.  Many
    thanks to SubZero (Maikeru Long) for simply telling me what the problem 
    was so I didn't have to spend hours tracking it down and making certain
    I had it fixed.
  - Changed messages to be more meaningful.
  - Fixed channels so you can have numeric channels.  Thanks to 
    Joe Cool (Mark Recio) from Butler for the bug report.
  - Updated help code for the new features.
  - The makefile no longer comes set up specifically for any OS.
  - I think that covers it.  I think.

29 November 1994 (Mon)
  - Got rid of some warnings.
  - Merged utility.c with Chris Eleveld's utility.c
  - Added support for HP/UX.  HP/UX Make seems to have a few problems 
    with the makefile I built, particularly with dependencies.
  - Moved getdtablesize() to getmax.c, and use it in the makefile.
    Wrote a fudge for getdtablesize() that seems to work under HP/UX.
    If getdtablesize() is available, it will be used, otherwise,
    my custom version will be used.  Used some sed magic to create
    maxconn.h, which is included by all files.

15 November 1994 (Tue)
  - Removed (completely) the old code for handleinput() from parse.c and
    newplayer.c.  The old code prior to this date could be re-enabled
    with #define OLDWAY.  This code seems to be stable enough that the
    old code is no longer needed.
  - Changed parse.c to allow all players to see the banlist.
  - Some fixes to the gag code to check array bounds.
  - Finally sick of the apparent problem with recursive removeplayer() calls,
    I now rely solely on handleinput() to detect dead players.  This way,
    sendtoplayer() won't call removeplayer() which should keep the linked
    list straight.  (I hope).  After all, we didn't have this problem
    before I optimized the list traversal.
  - Incremented the version number to 1.6.1d.

08 November 1994 (Tue)
  - More oversight fixes for the optimizations in the departure.  sheesh.

19 October 1994 (Wed)
  - Fixed, hopefully, the oversight that I forgot to set the leaving flag
    in removeplayer()  (Gee, that was dumb.)
  - Changed all references to MAXCONN to be references to getdtablesize()
    less some random value (not)  The subtracted value is the necessary
    number of available fd's that lorien needs to survive.
  - Added -DNO_LOG_CONNECT to the makefile and the sources.
  - Began preparations for shortening the player struct (see macros 
    and stuff in lorien.h)

17 October 1994 (Mon)
  - Changed a few things, most notably there was a bug in sendall()
    and removeplayer() that is now fixed.  By passing the line number
    of the player who is departing, we eliminate the "repeating departure"
    bug (hopefully) because we have the correct number when traversing the
    list.  Also edited the player struct to add a leaving flag.
  - Added 'tar' and 'shar' targets.

11 October 1994 (Tue)
  - Disabled Ban list code for now.
  - Fixed "lost line" bug (when more than one line was received per packet,
    only the first line was processed.)
  - Now works with char-by-char mode telnet connections.
  - Fixed /p hilites.
  - /p hilite command now echoes back the settings.
  - Added vt200 style linewrap.  This code does work with hilites.
  - Sped up some code.
  - Removed some redundant code.
  
12 September 1994 (Mon)
  - Finalized help system format.
  - Added priviliges flags for Yell, Whisper, Name, and Channel.  Thanks to
    Krelin (btcrowde@culebra.uccs.edu) for the suggestion.
  - Removed debug switch from the makefile.
  - Added history to the help file.  (subject to revision)
  - Updated help file to include proper seclevels in the power help section.
  - Packaged it up and called it 1.5.3a

7 September 1994 (Wed)

  - incorporated Hermit's servsock changes for port numbers.
  - rewrote the change_channel and wholist code completely to accomodate...
  - named channels.
  - added secure channels.
  - added message toggles
  - added port in the second who list
  - added /p beeps
  - removed some frivolous garbage such as zoning (which wasn't even
    available anymore)
  - removed the sysop message in the logs since few sysops pay attention to it.
  - changed the help files.
  - added /o and /l (apparent hostname change and level show toggle)
  - levels now show for everyone.  empowered persons can change their
    apparent power level and hostname.

20 July 1994 (Wed)

  - altered servsock.c fcntl() statement for SCO:
    if FNDELAY is undefined, attempt to use O_NDELAY
  - altered passfeof.c and passfread.c
    there was a bug which would corrupt the stack frame on
    some systems due to NUL-ing bytes referenced from the password
    structure in padd() which lay outside the structure.
  - moved fclose(testfile) in filetest.c so that things might seem to be
    right.
  - added a note to the makefile for SCO to get the socket routines.
    this may be valid for other UNIX's as well.
  - incorporated Chris Eleveld's changes for the Bull/DPX machine in
    Romania.  Bull/DPX needs some special LIBS.  See the Makefile
  - changed the inclusion of <string.h> and <strings.h> so that
    most reasonable BSD systems should be detected via the preprocessor define
    BSD and STRICT_BSD
  - reworked password routines to work (hopefully) on most systems.
 
  (JAB, Creel)

Some-time back before summer of 93

  - Added line gagging.
  - Removed a bunch of silly power commands (hide player, etc.)
  - Fixed forced poses.
  - Added whisper echoing and hushes.
  - Removed /p logging.
  - Removed the "omnipotent" channel where all /p's and private convos could
    be heard.
  - Added password name protection.
